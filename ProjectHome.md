The aim of this plugin is to use XSLT to extract metadata from HTML DOM structures.

<br>
<div>
| Your Data | --> | Parse-html plugin or TIKA plugin| --> | DOM structure | --> |XSLT plugin |<br>
</div>

<ul>The main advantage is that:<br>
<li> You won't have to produce any java code, only XSLT and configuration<br>
<li> It can process DOM structure from DocumentFragment (@see NekoHtml and @see TagSoup)<br>
<li> It is HtmlParseFilter plugin compatible and can be plugged as any other plugin (parse-js, parse-swf, etc...)<br>
